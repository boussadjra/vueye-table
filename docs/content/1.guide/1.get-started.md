# Get Started

In this guide, we will go through the process of installing Vueye and creating a simple table using Vueye Table.

## Introduction

Vueye Table is a Vue component that can be used to display data in a table. It is a lightweight and easy to use component that is highly customizable. It provides a lot of features such as sorting, searching, filtering, and grouping. It also supports pagination and server-side data loading.

## Installation

To install Vueye Table, you can use npm, yarn or pnpm.

### Vue SPA :

::code-group
```bash [pnpm] i-logos-pnpm
pnpm install vueye-table

## Usage

To utilize Vueye Table, start by providing an array of objects to the `data` prop. Each object represents a row in the table, with keys corresponding to the columns. The header keys are automatically formatted for human readability and displayed in the table. Nested objects are handled as grouped columns.

::code-group
```html [Vue] i-logos-vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { VueyeTable } from 'vueye-table'; 
const users = [
  {
    name: "Leanne Graham",
    email: "Sincere@april.biz",
    address: {
      city: "Gwenborough",
      street: "Kulas Light",
      suite: "Apt. 556",
      zipcode: "92998-3874",
    },
  },
  // Additional users...
];
</script>

<template>
  <VueyeTable :data="users" />
</template>
```

```html [Nuxt] i-logos-nuxt-icon
<script setup lang="ts">
const users = [
  {
    name: "Leanne Graham",
    email: "Sincere@april.biz",
    address: {
      city: "Gwenborough",
      street: "Kulas Light",
      suite: "Apt. 556",
      zipcode: "92998-3874",
    },
  },
  // Additional users...
];
</script>
<template>
  <VueyeTable :data="users" />
</template>
```
::

In this example, the `users` array contains objects representing user data, including name, email, and address. The `VueyeTable` component is then used in the template to render the table with the provided data.
